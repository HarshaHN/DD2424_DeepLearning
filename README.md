# Deep Learning for Data Science Problems
Date: Apr-May 2019 | Author: Harsha HN harshahn@kth.se | 
Part of the course 'Deep Learning in Data Science' presented at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden.

# How the software is organized
This was developed using MATLAB scripts.

- `A1`: To develop multi-linear classifier and trained on mini-batch gradient descent with cross-entropy loss for image classification task. Gives a top accuracy of 36.72% and this depicts the need of deep layers for this case.

- `A2`: To develop deep-layer multi-linear classifier and trained on mini-batch gradient descent with cross-entropy loss for image classification task. Cyclic learning strategy shall be employed. Gives a top accuracy of 65.52% and this depicts the need of advanced DNN solutions for this case.

- `A3`: To predict the language of a surname from its spelling. 'Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text
Classification' from [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.01626.pdf). Achieved an accuracy of 45.91%

- `A4`: To develop RNN based text character synthesizer which can produce textual phrases.

# Usage
Run one.m, two.m, three.m and four.m in A1, A2, A3 and A4 respectively.

# Keywords
Deep learning, CNN, Computer Vision, RNN, NLP
